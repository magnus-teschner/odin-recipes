    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>To begin making a mouthwatering lasagna, you'll first need to gather the necessary ingredients. 
        Start with fresh lasagna noodles, ground meat (commonly a mixture of beef and pork), onion, garlic, 
        tomato sauce, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, and a medley of herbs such as basil, 
        oregano, and parsley. Begin by saut√©ing finely chopped onions and minced garlic in a large skillet until they turn 
        translucent. Add the ground meat and cook it until it browns, breaking it apart with a spatula for an even texture. 
        Stir in the tomato sauce and let the mixture simmer, allowing the flavors to meld together. Meanwhile, prepare the 
        cheese filling by combining ricotta, grated mozzarella, Parmesan, beaten eggs, and a sprinkle of herbs in a separate bowl. 
        Boil the lasagna noodles until they're al dente, then drain and set them aside.</p>

    <p>With all the components ready, it's time to assemble the lasagna. Preheat your oven to a moderate temperature. 
        Begin with a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom of a large baking dish, spreading it evenly. 
        Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top, followed by a generous spread of the cheese mixture. 
        Repeat these layers, ending with a final layer of noodles. Top the lasagna with more tomato sauce and 
        a sprinkling of additional mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses for a golden, bubbly finish. Cover the dish 
        with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Allow it to bake for about 30-40 minutes, or until 
        the cheese is melted and the edges are lightly browned. Towards the end of the baking time, remove the foil 
        to let the cheese develop a delightful crust. Once done, let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before slicing 
        into it. This allows the layers to settle, making it easier to serve up hearty portions of this delectable Italian 
        classic. Enjoy your homemade lasagna with a side of garlic bread and a fresh green salad for a satisfying, 
        comforting meal.</p>
